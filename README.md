  You will need to modify your hosts file within your emulator to point to your local install of isrenepissed
  becuase the API for the site is currently not available.  If you don't have a local install, then you probably
  shouldn't be messing around with this app.
  
  Easy instructions for updating your hosts file can be found [on this blog](http://www.bradcurtis.com/2011/02/13/hosts-file-google-android-emulator/)
